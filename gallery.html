     <!--portfix gives the section a bottom padding to keep distance-->

     <p>Birthdays are extremely important to me. They are times that bring families together to celebrate a specific person. I always try to capture the personality of each individual for specialty cakes. We also have plenty of traditional cakes to choose from! Just click the pic!</p>
